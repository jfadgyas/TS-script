							You identified several errors. On the last non-reinforced frame 2 containers were loaded, which is too heavy. According to the paperwork these wagons can be loaded with just one container in the middle. On top of that, the 40ft container doesn't have permission to carry radioactive things. With these conditions the wagon can not be used in traffic, those containers must be reloaded. To prevent further delays, take out the last loaded wagon from the train! Follow the instructions of the <i>RangierLeiter!</i>
